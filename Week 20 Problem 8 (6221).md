Find a formula for the area of the triangle with vertices (in polar coordinates) $(r_1,\theta_1)$, $(r_2, \theta_2)$, and $(r_3,\theta_3)$.

We'll call these points $T_{1}$, $T_{2}$, and $T_{3}.$
First, let's add a fourth point $O$ at the origin $(r, \theta) = (0,0)$ which we will assume is inside the triangle.

Now it will likely be easier to find the area between 
$$A = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{ 4a^2b^2 - (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)^2 }$$
