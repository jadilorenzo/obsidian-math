(a) Prove that for all $y \ge 0,$ there exists a unique real number $x$ such that
$$xe^x = y.$$
(b) By part (a), for $y \ge 0,$ we can let $f(y)$ be the unique real number such that
$$f(y) e^{f(y)} = y.$$Find
$$\int_0^e f(x) \ dx.$$
(a)
Let $g(x) = xe^x$, part (a) requires that we prove $g(x)$ is continuous from $[0, \infty)$. Let's differentiate it!
$$
\frac{d}{dx}g(x) = xe^x+e^x
$$
Since this is real for $x \in [0,\infty)$, we know this function is continuous.

(b)
$\boxed{e - 1}$
