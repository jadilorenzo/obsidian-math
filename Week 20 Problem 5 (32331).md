Describe the shape of the graph of $$r = \frac{1}{1 + e \cos \theta},$$ when plotted using polar coordinates. Here, $e$ is a parameter that varies over real numbers, and the shape of the graph will depend on the value of $e.$

From values of $e$ such that $|e| < 1$. The graph is hyperbolic in ratio to $e$, always going through the points $(0,1)$ and $(0,-1)$.

At $|e| > 1$, the graph is an oval. It is a perfect circle at $0$ (as might be expected.)
