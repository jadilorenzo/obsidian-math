Write parametric equations for an ellipse with foci $(2,0)$ and $(3,1)$ passing through $(1,2).$

This circle must be centered on $\left(\frac{5}{2},\frac{1}{2}\right)$. Therefore we can tentatively define 
$$
\begin{align*}
u\left(t\right)&=c_{0}\cos(t)+\frac{5}{2} \\ v\left(t\right)&=c_{1}\sin(t)+\frac{1}{2}.
\end{align*}
$$
However, no matter what $c$ we use our function will never be slanted. Upon experimentation, if we assign $$v(t) = c_{0} \sin\left( t + \frac{\pi}{4} \right) + \frac{1}{2},$$
the ellipse takes on a near $45°$ slant. This is desirable because we want to place $(1,2)$ on the ellipse's edge and the foci on the major axis. However, our function is only *near* a $45°$ slant when we use $c$ values where $\frac{c_{0}}{c_{1}} \approx 1$. Therefore, it seems
