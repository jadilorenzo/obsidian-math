A circle of radius 2 rolls along a flat surface at a constant rate, as shown below. A point which has a distance of 3 from the center of the circle is fixed with respect to the circle.  
  
Let $A$ be the midpoint of the arc, and let $B$ be a point where the path of the point intersects the surface. Let $v_A$ and $v_B$ be the speeds of the point at $A$ and $B,$ respectively. Compute $\frac{v_A}{v_B}.$
We know the formula for the trajectory of the point at the radius $2$ is $$\left(4\pi t\ -\ 2\sin\left(2\pi t\right),\ 2-\ 2\cos\left(2\pi t\right)\right)$$
With some experimentation and careful reasoning, we see the path of our point is $$\left(6\pi t\ -\ 3\sin\left(3\pi t\right),\ 2-3\cos\left(3\pi t\right)\right).$$
We know point $A$ occurs at $x=2\pi$. However, we do not know the $x$-coordinate of $B$. We know $y = 0 = 6\pi t\ -\ 3\sin\left(3\pi t\right)$.
$$
\begin{align}
0 = 6\pi t\ -\ 3\sin\left(3\pi t\right)
\end{align}
