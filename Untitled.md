(a) A tank initially contains $100$ gallons of water, and $s$ pounds of dissolved sugar. A hose is turned on, which fills the tank at a rate of $3$ gallons per minute, containing a concentration of a $\frac{1}{4}$ pound of sugar per gallon. The tank is also drained at a rate of $3$ gallons per minute, so the tank always contains $100$ gallons of water.

Find the amount of sugar in the tank after $t$ minutes, in pounds. (Assume that the tank is well-stirred so that the concentration of sugar in the tank is uniform.)

(b) In the long term, what happens to the amount of sugar in the tank? Explain why this answer makes sense.

(a)
Derive differential equation from problem statement: $y'=\frac34-\frac{3}{100}y$

Solve differential equation:
$$y = -\left(25-s\right)e^{\frac{-3x}{100}}+25$$
(b)

Sugar concentration approaches $\frac{1}{4}$Â pound of sugar per gallon for the whole tank.
