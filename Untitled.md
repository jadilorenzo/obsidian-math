The function $f(x),$ defined for $x > 0,$ is positive, differentiable, and decreasing. The function $f(x)$ has the following property: Let $P$ be a point on the graph, and draw the tangent to the graph at $P.$ Let the tangent meet the $x$-axis and $y$-axis at $A$ and $B,$ respectively. Then $P$ is always the midpoint of $\overline{AB}.$Â 

Find all functions $f(x)$ that have this property.

First, let's find $A$ and $B$ in terms of $f(x)$ . 

Assuming $P = (p, f(p)),$ $$\begin{align*}
A&=(2p,0)\\
B&=(0,2f(p)).\\
\end{align*}$$
The equation for the tangent line at $P$ is $y-f(p)=f'(p)(x-p)$,


Its coordinates are $(p, f(p)).$ The equation of the tangent line at $P$ $y-f(p)=f'(p)(x-p)$, or in standard form$$y=f'(p)x-f'(p)p+f(p).$$Because $A$ is on the intersection of the tangent line and the $x$ axis, the $y$ coordinate will be $0$.

This means that the $x$ coordinate of $A$ can be represented as
$$\begin{align*}
0&=f'(p)x-f'(p)p+f(p)\\
x&=\dfrac{f'(p)p-f(p)}{f'(p)}.\\
\end{align*}$$
Therefore, the coordinates of $A$ are $\left(\dfrac{f'(p)p-f(p)}{f'(p)},0\right)$.

Moving on to $B$, we can apply the same strategy, but this time set $x=0$ as this is the intersection with the $y$-axis. This lends us
$$\begin{align*}
y&=-f'(p)p+f(p),\\
\end{align*}$$
Which means the coordinates of $B$ are $\left(0,-f'(p)p+f(p)\right)$.

As $P$ is the midpoint of $A$ and $B$ and these fall on the $x$ and $y$ axis respectively, the $x$ coordinate of $A$ is double the $x$ coordinate of $P$, and the $y$ coordinate of $B$ is double the $y$ coordinate of $P$. This means that
$$\begin{align*}
A&=(2p,0)\\
B&=(0,2f(p)).\\
\end{align*}$$
We now have two different expressions for each of the coordinates of $A$ and $B$! Setting the meaningful components equal, we obtain the two equations
$$\begin{align*}
2p&=\dfrac{f'(p)p-f(p)}{f'(p)}\\
2f(p)&=-f'(p)p+f(p).\\
\end{align*}$$
Using the second equation, we can determine an expression for $f'(p)$ in terms of $p$ and $f(p)$, giving us $f'(p)=-\dfrac{f(p)}p$.
