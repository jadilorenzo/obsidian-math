Obviously $y = e^x$ is a solution to $y''' = y$. Show that $\displaystyle y = e^{-\frac{x}{2}}\cos\left(\frac{\sqrt3}{2}x\right)$ is also a solution. 

Note that if $\omega = -\dfrac12 + \dfrac{\sqrt3}{2}i$, then $\omega^3 = 1$. Why does this imply that the complex function $y = e^{\omega x}$ is a solution to $y''' = y$?
