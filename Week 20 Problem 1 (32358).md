The graph of $r = 1 + \sin \theta$ is drawn. The tangent to this graph at $\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}$ is drawn. Find the $x$-intercept of this tangent.

The equation for a line that goes through $(0,0)$ at angle $\theta$ is $$y = \tan(\theta)x.$$
Conversions:
$$
(r, \theta) = \left(\sqrt{ x^2 +y^2 }, \tan^{-1}\left( \frac{y}{x} \right)\right)
$$

At $\frac{\pi}{4}$, $r = 1 + \frac{\sqrt{ 2 }}{2}$
