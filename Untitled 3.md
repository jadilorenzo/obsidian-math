We have sadly spent most of our marriage living extremely separate lives with little connection and even less friendship for an insanely long time now. Your primary focus was working, studying the Bible, teaching, engaging in sports and other activities for relaxation, leading worship and often connecting with numerous friends; my life has been much more isolated primarily focused on you, the kids, and managing the household.

Following health challenges and a hip injury, I did begin Pilates in recent years, but it was likely the only independent weekly activity I have done outside of our home for any length of time for nearly 30+ years of our marriage. Yet simultaneous to my relative isolation, your list of discretionary activities was long and varied.

Even while you were working full time and carrying leadership roles at the hospital, you judiciously protected your discretionary time and rarely did it include me! Believe me, having stepped back to better see our patterns, I have been pondering how and why did I tolerate this. Guilt tripping is the answer—some self-inflicted, but I believe more the majority of it came from you.  

I was recently reminded of how you subtly guilt trip me when I recently asked to have dinner with Sandy and Sally and to visit Lily. Only recently am I realizing how personally devastating this has been. Your abdications and laziness left me in a no-win catch-22 situation:

(1) I could either allow significant areas of our marriage, home life, and family to deteriorate
or
(2) I could take on your neglected responsibilities giving you freedom.

Sadly, while you gained freedom from my labors, I gained stress and overwhelm and resentment from you for the loss of control you felt from my picking up the load you abdicated. I fully admit that my natural conscientiousness and striving made me an easy target for your guilt tripping. The result was isolation for me and that isolation gave you greater control.

I was blind and others were not close enough to me to help me see your frequent and problematic vacillations between your passivity and authoritarian rule. Your needs and the needs of our family, including our aging parents, were so demanding I almost forgot I had needs. When I repeatedly said the load was too heavy, you didn’t listen. Given your neglect, blame, and extreme reactions, asking for help became more costly than doing it myself, so the suffering continued.

We see our challenges as nearly polar opposite. You think I have submission issues, I think I lacked healthy boundaries (a lack of control issue, not an excessive control issue). I don’t desire to continue to live like a worn out emotionally drained rag living with daily stress subject to your emotional vacillations, your falsehoods, and your excessive projection of blame onto me. I am a child of God and should be treated with greater respect than I have been for nearly our entire marriage. I may be learning this late but submission isn’t always a wife’s proper response.

The answer is I always felt like I could never get what was supposedly “my” responsibility. I certainly didn’t need any help feeling like I didn’t measure up—that was already my struggle—and your struggle was the opposite, you were generally overconfident.
  
Despite my attempts for us to find ways to improve our marriage, you have resisted. At times, you even paid for counsel, but nearly always controlled it in a way that resisted outside accountability. You continue to resist outside counsel and accountability. Your words regarding our marital interactions often include false narratives and gross mischaracterizations of events in our lives.

One of your favorite topics in our household is biblical headship and respect for authority. You consider my desire for pastoral care evidence of insubordination to your authority because you don’t want it and don’t think it’s necessary. You clearly label me as the reason we cannot agree.

Within the last week, I attempted to get you to acknowledge an avoidance and agitation/anger pattern that has been repeating in our marriage for at least more than a decade and perhaps much longer. When I asked a few days ago if you could see this destructive pattern, you acknowledged the avoidance but not the agitation and anger that has been excruciatingly destructive in our marriage and extremely disrespectful and belittling to me. What I term our avoidance and agitation pattern is characterized by one to two years of almost complete estate planning without me.
  
I said that sounded unwise and potentially financially wasteful given I had choices to make and you also would need my signature. You said you were moving ahead without me regardless. Ouch again. I ask you to consider if your adversarial and domineering approach might contribute to how challenging it is for us to find unity and to work collaboratively and respectfully.

Regarding the car purchase, you told me the make, model, and approximate year of the vehicle you wanted to purchase. Without saying anything about my previously expressed preference to save money by delaying the purchase until one of our three cars failed, you said you intended to purchase the vehicle in the next 30 days.

Next, you invited me to participate in the selection of the vehicle. I said it didn’t seem that you wanted me to participate; you reassured me that you did. I asked if we would be deciding together as husband and wife; you assured me that we would. Almost immediately after I said I would like to participate, you told me that I was too busy to participate. Whiplash! I should have anticipated it because this kind of bait and switch is actually extremely common.  

I know that you frequently desire to appear more flexible and accommodating than what you actually are. You are a master at getting what you want often by starting out claiming the opposite. You elaborated this week that your “preference” takes priority over all other “preferences” in the household. I have no idea why you often hide your preferences, but this is commonplace.

To me, being honest and direct in communications and desire is forthright. You even explain that your “preference” takes priority over all other “preferences” in the household. Our counselor used to tell us that being clear is kind; you, however, continue to feel that being indirect is better.

You probably should consider how your bait and switch and your other camouflaged and indirect methods of getting what you want lead to feeling manipulated. You have even told our sons that it’s wrong to have a strong opinion. Really? Why is that? I think your preference for indirectness and hiding genuine opinions likely adds to our challenges.

Additionally, when we began discussing purchasing mulch in the last week, my preference was to use pine nuggets vs. triple shredded since they lasted longer, and also my preference was to hire someone to spread it instead of doing it ourselves. You were the one getting the bids. Shortly after our discussion about mulch, you sent me a link for purchasing triple shredded, not pine nuggets, and no price on getting someone to install it. Your text said:
 
> “Check out the kinds of mulch they offer and let me know your preference (I checked a few places and these are competitive for pricing ($21/yard, $50 for delivery) I’d probably get two yards.”

In our discussion, you didn’t mention that you didn’t want pine nuggets nor did you mention that you were unwilling to get a bid for an installed price. After sending that text, you then took a nap, went to work, and before we connected the following morning you sent this text:  

> “After I drop your dad off, I’m going to Soil Toppers to order some mulch. Give me a call when you get out of Pilates.”

So I called you repeatedly immediately after Pilates attempting to discuss pine nuggets and getting an installer bid. Given I was unable to reach you and I felt we needed more than two yards, I began placing calls to get bids for installed pine nuggets. When I got the first bid and still couldn’t reach you, I texted you the details of the bid:

> “I tried to reach you by telephone to respond to your request [to call you after Pilates, before you ordered triple shredded]. Please call me before going to Soil Toppers. I have some information that may be helpful and save some back breaking work. I have an installed price of pine nuggets (which last longer than the triple shredded at Soil Toppers) and they said they are available to install sometime after June 23 and that would be less back breaking. My quick thought is (1) you have back problems and (2) we have lots of tasks that we cannot hire people to do BUT spreading mulch is one that we can hire others to do for us. You may feel differently which is fine, but I would pay someone to spread it and work on other projects instead. Reminds me of a saying from Michael Farris from one of our earliest homeschool conferences—‘don’t use a high skill worker for a low skill job.’ Yet I do 100% appreciate that you see the need for mulch and that you want the yard to look nicer soon. So do I. So thanks for that.”

Glad we and my silence is not agreement, instead it’s simply me choosing to live as peaceably with you as possible. Challenging your “facts” almost never leads to greater insight, responsibility, contrition or even to greater understanding and connection; instead it leads to degradation and emotional escalation.

Yet when a decision is being made, I often do need to express how and why I disagree with your “facts.” When I share my perspective, I am frequently interrupted and must be extremely forceful even to be heard. After I express my perspective, you often illogically continue with your preplanned talking points as if I said nothing. When I stop and ask a question to get you to reflect and respond to what I just said, you typically answer a question different from the one I asked and simply don’t answer. That feels disrespectful and manipulative.

As the conversations progress, the false narratives and the blame often continue. Given the emotions are rising, I typically ask for a break because nothing constructive happens when emotions are high. You often resist my appeal for a break by erroneously characterizing it as me walking out on you. Yet long ago we agreed to honor an appeal for a break that either of us makes when emotions are elevated. I may listen a bit longer to make it less frustrating and clear that I am not just walking out on you. Despite this, sometimes you are still pushing your points and blaming me as I calmly depart the room or as I warn—repeatedly warn—you that I will need to end a call if you persist in staying on the same emotionally charged topic.

I don’t like it, but I have learned to remain firm and resolute. Next, instead of giving space for a break and a cooling of emotions, you almost immediately begin to pressure me to engage as soon as possible. Rarely is there any reflection or contrition. You resist accountability. After long discussions, you say you are willing to get counsel and then you are not—and that has been going on for many, many years. You resist even the two of us analyzing a recording of what goes wrong when we attempt to work through issues. I have suggested this so perhaps you could see what I see but you continue to deny.

At times you characterize my request for pastoral counseling as insubordination to your biblical headship role. Honestly, your implementation of biblical headship feels increasingly oppressive and authoritarian.
