All I have to do now is write up my results and shift the $t$ range...

Suppose a planet revolves around a star at radius $R$ and the planet has a moon that revolves around the planet at radius $r$ with $0<r<R$. (For simplicity, assume that all motion is in the same plane.) At time $t=0$, the planet is at $(R,0)$ and the moon is at $(R+r,0)$ The planet takes 1 year to revolve around the star and the moon takes $\frac14$ year to revolve around the planet.  
  
(a) Write parametric equations for the position of the moon at time $t$ (in years). (You can assume all movement is counterclockwise.) As a check, at time $t=\frac12$ the position of the moon should be $(r-R,0)$ and at $t=1$ it should be back to $(R+r,0)$.  
  
(b) Sketch a graph of the moon's path.  
  
(c) Does the moon ever come to a "full stop" relative to the star?
