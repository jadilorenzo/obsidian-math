The equation for exponential growth is $f(x)=c_{1}e^{c_{2}x}$.
If we set 1970 as year 0, we immediately know $c_1 = 3.712$ because that places $f$ through $(0, 3.712)$.
Now all we must do is solve for the point $(10, 4.453)$.
$$3.712e^{10x}=4.453$$
yields
$$x=\frac{\ln \left(\frac{4.453}{3.712}\right)}{10}$$
making our equation
$$f\left(x\right)=3.712e^{0.01820072114x}$$
$$f(38) = 7.41272574312$$
