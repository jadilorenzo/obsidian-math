Sherri,

Here are some of my summary thoughts on what has transpired of late.

Having confessed my sin of abdication of leadership/responsibility, acknowledging this a result of my laziness, irresponsibility, lack of initiative and its resulting effects on you and our children and household, I have repented and begun to re-engage in my God given responsibility for my household.

I am the head of our household and as my wife, you are God's gift to me and helpmeet. We are "one flesh" and ought to be in close communion/covenant with one another physically and spiritually. Ideally, we should be in communication daily although we may need to work independently towards our common goals, which we should also discuss. I want your input and need your input on many things. Even on decisions I'm comfortable making without you, 1 want you to be aware of what I'm intending on doing. At anytime, if you see me about to make a foolish decision, please feel free to share your concerns. However, please do not be offended if I choose a different approach. I promise to be careful, prayerful and willing to hear other perspectives or get counsel if I believe it's indicated. However, to be clear, unless what I am proposing to do is sinful/immoral or totally bananas, lam not going to submit my decision making to a "third party" for arbitration.

Having said that, I do understand that my taking new responsibility for various things may be difficult for you since much of the responsibility has been borne by you and you are understandably invested in many of our household matters (ie. finances, homeschooling, etc.) ! understand that you might easily feel "bulldozed" by my taking initiative and responsibility for issues going forward. In light of this, I have attempted to start in areas that might produce the least amount of conflict or things that I can do by myself such as yard work. (Remember: dating back years now I have asked that you list and prioritize household matters so that we could plot a direction forward. That never materialized and I made own lists and my own prioritization) Even with this, my approach is to keep in good communication with you and to get your ideas or feedback on what I'm doing. I am willing to change direction and priorities if you can convince me to do so.

Today we discussed ground cover/mulch and I'll get that ball rolling using your research.

The other issues that are on my current "short list" are:

1. ﻿﻿﻿Auto preferences: I'm looking at buying a 2022 Lexus Rx SUV/ Sport similar to what we have. I'm looking at Silver, Black or Blue with light interior (sport model with red interior is pretty cool as well. I'd like to hear your ideas. Probably -45k for low mileage vehicle.
2. ﻿﻿﻿Engaging a lawyer/firm to finish our Irrevocable Trust and wills, directives, etc. 1 want to hear your views on how to select a person/firm to help us. I'd like to share mine.
3. ﻿﻿﻿I'd like to get USAA to look at our roof and get the ball rolling on that process. I need your expertise and contact information.
4. ﻿﻿﻿I'd like to meet again about Homeschooling: update from your trip and next steps for each of the boys

I know our conversations on household projects have been difficult. I don't believe they need to be this hard.

A couple of months ago you asked if we could engage Andy Davis again, which I agreed to do. You were going to meet with him first one on one, and then we were going to sit down with him to discuss together what he recommends going forward. I agreed to meeting every couple of weeks if we all felt that would be helpful.

Until our future meeting with Andy which you requested, I am going to continue to move forward cautiously on household/family projects. As I have stated before, with the enormity of the number of tasks ahead of us, this can't be done one project at a time, but rather requires parallel processing.

Please ponder this letter and the short list above for discussion asap. It is right for us to work together for we will be better off and happier if we do so. Today, you requested that we discuss only one issue and gave me no answer as to when you were open to discussing the remaining issues on this short list. I am hoping that now that you know what is on my list, you'll be able to have a conversation with me about them. If you are not willing to discuss these types of issues over the next couple of days, unless there is a compelling reason, I will proceed without your input until you are ready to work together.

I love you and I'm grateful for you and our marriage.

I am praying that God does a miraculous work in each of us to bring us together in joy and love and unity.

Bob
