Let $y\in[0,0.1]$. Show that $1+y$ can be used to approximate $e^y$ to within $0.5\%$ error.

Let's call $f(x) = e^y.$

Firstly, $g(y) = 1+y$ is the first-degree Taylor series for $e^y$ at $0$ (which is a good start.)

At $0$, $f(0) = g(0) = 1$ with a $0\%$ error.
At $0.1$, $g(0.1) = 1.1$ and $f(0.1) = e^0.1 = 1.1051709181$. This is an error margin of about $0.5\%.$
